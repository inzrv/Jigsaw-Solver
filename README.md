# Jigsaw-Solver

This program allows you to create and solve simple picture puzzles. 

This one was meant as an introduction to OpenCV, so I implemented a simple greedy algorithm with an obvious metric for two pieces. It does a pretty good job on 4x4 or 5x5 puzzles. With any luck, it will solve 7x7 correctly as well.
